A centralized workflow involves keeping multiple researchers up to date with the remote project repository. The project is represented as a chain of commits, that modify it step by step. Datasets typically don't live in the repository, but its good practice to adhere to the same goal of applying a linear chain of "commits" to your data. The practice establishes clear data provenence, or the knowledge of a dataset's history and ownership.
